https://github.com/gilpasternak35/AgingGAN - A GAN trained for a Deep Learning course that takes faces and ages them. Includes both a custom U-Net Variation (designed from first principles) and a modification of CycleGAN. Also includes some interpetability work, including Guided Backpropagation and Feature Visualization.

https://github.com/gilpasternak35/Likelihood - An ML-Centric Data Quality Engine trained to identify anomalies in data, irrespective of domain. Includes a multitude of methods, including KDE Estimation, Time-Series based prediction, and PCA.

https://github.com/gilpasternak35/SongRecommender - A recommender system (collaborative filtering + content based algorithm based) that beats some existing baselines for song recommendations, equipped with a smooth UX design.
