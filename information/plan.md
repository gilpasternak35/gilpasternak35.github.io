I want a beautiful, elegant, well designed, well organized website with the following sections:

About me - a section with a personal bio

Experience - a resume style section detailing my experiences

Fun / Projects - A section outlining my projects and things I do for enjoyment.

Contact - a field to allow people to contact me.

I will proceed to detail each section below:

About me - simply use the following text: "Hi, I’m Gil — currently a Member of Technical Staff at Fastino, where I work on foundational Language Model research. My interests sit at the intersection of natural language modeling, interpretability, and (some) Machine Learning theory.

Previously, I was a Researcher at Loris (acquired by Contentsquare), one of the earliest core engineers at Great Expectations, and did AI research at NVIDIA. I earned my Bachelor’s in Mathematics and Computer Science and Master’s in Computer Science from UC San Diego, where I was fortunate to be advised by Misha Belkin (http://misha.belkin-wang.org) and Ramamohan Paturi (https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/profile?id=118).

Outside of work, you can usually find me reading mechanistic interpretability papers, lifting heavy things, or getting into lengthy conversations with Uber drivers. I love chatting about interpretability, language models, or the weird quirks of language-based systems — if this is something that also interests you, reach out!"

Experience: Simply Embed my Resume into the page, it can be found in the information folder.

Fun/Projects - Render the projects in project_links.md under the information tabs as separate blocks, along with individual descriptions.

Contact: Allow a contact field where a user can leave their name and email, and a message which will be automatically sent to gilpasternak35@gmail.com
